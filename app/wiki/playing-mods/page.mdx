# Installing and Playing Mods

<Box>

When you open Kristal, the main menu has an option to open the mods folder. This is where you can place the mods you have downloaded.

Note that, if packaged correctly, you do not have to unzip the mod. You can just place the zip file in the mods folder.

## "The mod doesn't show up in the mods list!" [doesnt-show-up]

If a mod doesn't show up in the mod list, it may have been packaged incorrectly. If it's a ZIP archive, make sure it's not nested in a folder.

**You cannot play libraries as mods.** Libraries are *for use* in mods, and cannot be played alone.

## "The option doesn't work/crashes Kristal!" [manual-paths]

The cause of this bug is unknown, and most likely is out of our control. In this case, you'll have to navigate to the mods folder manually.

### Beta/Nightly release

The path is at `C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\Kristal\mods\`.
