# Creating a Mod

<Box>

In the Kristal mod list, there's a button at the bottom which says "Create a new mod".

![](/wiki/create_new_mod.png)

In here, you can configure things like the name of your mod,
the description, what chapter of DELTARUNE it's based on,
and you can configure each feature changed between chapters.

You can view the full list of configurable features [here](/wiki/configurable-features).

## Installing Visual Studio Code
---

Visual Studio Code is the recommended code editor for Kristal mods. You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Once it's installed, open the extensions tab on the left-hand side of the screen, and search for "Kristal". Install the extension. This is our official extension for Kristal support in Visual Studio Code, and it will make your life much easier.

That's it, you're now ready!

## Opening your mod in Visual Studio Code
---

With your mod folder open, either right click inside of it, or right click the folder itself, and click "**Open with Code**".
In the screenshot below, I'm using Visual Studio Code Insiders, but it's the same no matter what version you use.

Make sure to click "**Yes, I trust the authors**" when prompted -- you're the author, because this is your mod!

## Using Visual Studio Code
---

The left-hand side of the screen has the **file explorer**. These are the files in your mod! You can click on them once to preview them, or double click to open them.

(A preview tab has an *italics* name, and will get replaced by other files you try to open. Most of the time, if you want to edit a file, you should open it normally instead of previewing it.)

---

### The Assets Folder

The assets folder stores, well, assets. It's where sprites, sounds, fonts, music and speech bubbles get stored, to be loaded by the engine.

---

### The Scripts Folder

Scripts are the code of your mod. This folder contains all of them, whether it's cutscenes, enemies, or even data, like items.
