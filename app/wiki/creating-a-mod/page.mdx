# Creating a Mod

<Box>

In the Kristal mod list, there's a button at the bottom which says "Create a new mod".

![](/wiki/create_new_mod.png)

In here, you can configure things like the name of your mod,
the description, what chapter of DELTARUNE it's based on,
and you can configure each feature changed between chapters.

You can view the full list of configurable features [here](/wiki/configurable-features).

## Installing Visual Studio Code
---

Visual Studio Code is the recommended code editor for Kristal mods. You can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Once it's installed, open the extensions tab on the left-hand side of the screen, and search for "Kristal". Install the extension. This is our official extension for Kristal support in Visual Studio Code, and it will make your life much easier.

That's it, you're now ready!
</Box>

## Opening your mod in Visual Studio Code
---

With your mod folder open, either right click inside of it, or right click the folder itself, and click "**Open with Code**".
In the screenshot below, I'm using Visual Studio Code Insiders, but it's the same no matter what version you use.

Make sure to click "**Yes, I trust the authors**" when prompted -- you're the author, because this is your mod!

## Using Visual Studio Code
---

The left-hand side of the screen has the **file explorer**. These are the files in your mod! You can click on them once to preview them, or double click to open them.

(A preview tab has an *italics* name, and will get replaced by other files you try to open. Most of the time, if you want to edit a file, you should open it normally instead of previewing it.)

## Mod Structure
---

Now you can see your mod files, let's talk folders! It's important to have an idea what folders contain which files.

---

### The Root Folder

The "root" folder refers to the topmost folder of your mod, the one that contains everything else! It's the same one you just opened with Visual Studio Code. 

You might hear it referred to as "the root of your mod", or just "your mod folder" as you've seen here.

As well as all the folders we're about to mention, there are two key files stored in here: `mod.lua` and `mod.json`.

`mod.lua` is where you can modfiy your `Mod` object. The `Mod` object can define code to be run for a variety of engine-determined event calls.

(The wiki doesn't have a list of event calls... but the `KRISTAL_EVENT` enum in the source code does! Here's a [quick link](https://github.com/KristalTeam/Kristal/blob/main/src/engine/vars.lua#L179) if you can't find it.)

`mod.json` is your mod's configuration file. Here you can change the chapter configurations you selected during mod creation, and also additional behaviours like the **initial save state** of your mod.

Many keys in `mod.json` **only apply to new save files**, so make sure to create fresh saves when testing changes to it!

---

### The Assets Folder

The assets folder stores, well, assets. It's where sprites, sounds, fonts, music and speech bubbles get stored, to be loaded by the engine.

Each type of asset is stored in it's own sub-folder.

#### Sprites - `assets/sprites` 

Stores all the textures/images for your mod. Accepted file types are `.png` or `.jpg`.

For animations, each frame should be saved seperately, with the frame number being attached to the end of the name like `_1`, `_2`, etc.

#### Sounds - `assets/sounds`

Stores all the sound files for your mod. Accepted file tyes are `.wav` and `.ogg`.

#### Music `assets/music`

Stores all the music files for your mod. Accepted file types are `.wav`, `.ogg`, and `.mp4` (`.ogg` is recommended).

You can modify the global in-game volume and pitch of any track in `mod.lua` with the `MUSIC_VOLUMES` and `MUSIC_PITCHES` tables:
```lua
function Mod:init()
    -- Example: How you would make WELCOME TO THE CITY (`cybercity.ogg`) detuned the same way it is in DELTARUNE
    MUSIC_VOLUMES["cybercity"] = 0.8
    MUSIC_PITCHES["cybercity"] = 0.97
end
```
#### Fonts - `assets/fonts`

Stores all the custom fonts (and any supporting information about them) for your mod. Accepted fonts are `.ttf`, `.fnt`, or `.png`.

#### Speech Bubbles - `assets/bubbles`

Stores speech bubble data in `.json` files. The actual sprites used to construct bubbles are stored in `assets/sprites/bubbles`. Sorry to burst your bubble...

(You can check out the [source code](https://github.com/KristalTeam/Kristal/tree/main/assets/bubbles) to see how the default bubbles are constructed.)

#### Shaders - `assets/shaders`

Stores shadercode for your mod. All shaders are `.glsl` files.

#### Videos - `assets/videos`

Stores video files for your mod. They must be encoded in the Ogg theora format (`.ogv`, `.ogg`) to play correctly.

#### Asset Paths

When referencing any type of Asset in your mod, the code will eventually call into `Assets` - you might even be doing so directly!

The file paths you use for assets should begin **inside the type's sub-folder** and **exclude the file extension**. 

For example, a sprite stored at `assets/sprites/world/events/sign.png` is just `world/events/sign` whenever you need to reference it in your code.

Note that some functions and features of the engine may look for assets from more specific locations. For example, `Game:setBorder()` searches starting from `assets/sprites/borders`.

#### Replacing Engine Assets

Assets used directly by the engine aren't visible inside your mod folder, but they're still loaded and accessed in the same way.

You can view the engine's assets from the `assets` folder of the [source code](https://github.com/KristalTeam/Kristal/tree/main). If you want to **replace** these assets (e.g. to reskin the UI) you can do so by placing your replacement texture at the **same file path in your mod's assets**!

### The Scripts Folder

Scripts are the code of your mod. This folder contains all of them, whether it's cutscenes, enemies, or even data, like items.

All scripts are `.lua` files, and each type of script must be inside a specific folder to be loaded.

Your mod will include empty folders for most types of script by default. Let's briefly introduce them all.

#### Battle - `scripts/battle`

This folder contains everything associated with battles in Kristal. There are several sub-folders of battle for each script type:

- `bullets` - for `Bullet` scripts.
- `cutscenes` - for `BattleCutscene`s or groups of `BattleCutscene`.
- `encounters` - for `Encounter` scripts.
- `enemies` - for `EnemyBattler` scripts.
- `waves` - for `Wave` scripts.

#### Borders - `scripts/borders`

The scripts in this folder define custom `Border` objects that support animations.

#### Data - `scripts/data`

This folder contains the scripts of everything data-based, like items. There are several sub-folders for each data type:

- `actors` - Scripts that define the data of your mod's characters.
- `items` - Scripts for all your mod's items.
- `party` - Scripts for your mod's custom party members.
- `recruits` - Scripts for all your enemies RECRUIT data.
- `spells` - Scripts for your mod's spells.

#### Hooks - `scripts/hooks`

This folder contains hook scripts - they're an advanced engine tool for modfiying engine code.

#### Legends - `scripts/legends`

This folder contains `LegendCutscene` scripts for... legend-styled cutscenes!

#### Objects - `scripts/objects`

This folder contains custom object types for your mod. You might use this folder for things like advanced spell effects and custom souls, as well as many other things.

#### World - `scripts/world`

This folder contains everything associated with maps and the world in Kristal. There are several sub-folders of world for each script type:

- `bullets` - for `WorldBullet` scripts.
- `cutscenes` - for `WorldCutscene`s of groups of `WorldCutscene`.
- `events` - for `Event`s - the type of objects that appear in maps.
- `maps` - for map files. 
- `scripts` - for generic script types - these are mainly used with the `script` and `interactable` events.
- `tilesets` - for all your tileset scripts.

#### Script IDs

Scripts load into a part of Kristal known as the `Registry`. When that happens, they are assigned an `id` you'll need to know to access them later.

The `id` assigned to a script is determined in two simple steps - it's very important to know them!

**Step 1.** The engine checks whether the script ID was defined explicitly as the second argument to `Class()` (in most scripts). If it is, that's the script's id.

**Step 2.** If the script doesn't have an explicit ID, the engine uses it's file path. This starts from the **subfolder of the script type**, not the `scripts` folder. 
For example, an item at `scripts/data/items/light/pencil.lua` would be assigned the id `light/pencil`.

These are also **case-sensitive** - `Light/Pencil` and `light/pencil` are considered completely seperate IDs!

#### Replacing Engine Scripts

Just like Assets, the engine has some scripts that are not visible from your mod folder. The only applies to `data` scripts.

The same procedure works for replacing data scripts as it does assets - look through the `data` folder of the [source code](https://github.com/KristalTeam/Kristal/tree/main), and create a file at the **same path** as the one in the engine to **replace** it.

### The Libraries Folder

Libraries are externally sourced code and assets - the [Libraries page](/wiki/using-libraries) will tell you more about them.

---

### The Preview Folder

The preview folder stores everything related to how your mod appears on the Kristal menu.

... Huh? There's no preview guide on the wiki? Quickly, cut to the end of the article!
