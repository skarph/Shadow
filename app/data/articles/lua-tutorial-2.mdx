# Hooking: Methods and Functions
---

## `Utils.hook` is a very powerful function that allows you to safely and dynamically replace any code.

```lua
Utils.hook(<table: table>, <index: string>, <hook: function>, >)

```

## A note on Classes, Lua, and Kristal
In Lua, all Classes and Instances of Classes are tables, just like arrays.
The only differene is how we use these tables we call Classes and Instances, and as such, they are built from simpler principles.
This article will explore how Object-Oriented Programming is constructed, as well as how it behaves, in Kristal. 

Pure Lua does not have a concept of a Class, nor is it Object-Oriented programming (OOP).
However, using the tools Lua provides, many people have constructed Prototype-Based programming, a type of OOP.
We will construct a simple Prototype-Based OOP for demonstration purpouses, and then using this knowledge, will explore the shorthands and convienences offered by Kristal for OOP.

## Prototyping in Lua
Consider the following table `horse_a`:
```lua
horse_a = {}
horse_a["food"] = "apple"
horse_a["sayFood"] = function(self)
    print(self["food"])
end
```

It has two values stored inside it: at `"food"` it is `"apple"`, and a `"sayFood"` that is a function.
This function takes in one argument called `self`, indexes it at `"food"`, and prints what value was at that index.
As expected, running the function providing itself, `horse_a`, as the arguments, prints "apple":

```lua
horse_a["sayFood"](horse_a)
> apple
```
Now let us add a similarly structured table `horse_b`:

```lua
horse_a = {}
horse_a["food"] = "apple"
horse_a["sayFood"] = function(self)
    print(self["food"])
end

horse_b = {}
horse_b["food"] = "hay" --not too fond of fruits...
horse_b["sayFood"] = function(self)
    print(self["food"])
end
```
While the value at `"food"` is different between `horse_a` and `horse_b`, they both have this index filled, as well as have functions at `"sayFood"` that preform the same action.
Thus, we can use them interchangibly:
```lua
horse_a["sayFood"](horse_a)
--> apple
horse_b["sayFood"](horse_a)
--> apple

horse_a["sayFood"](horse_b)
--> hay
horse_b["sayFood"](horse_b)
--> hay
```
If we remove this redundant function from one of `horse_a` or `horse_b`, and exclusively use the remaining function, we have made one of these tables the "protoype" of the other:
```lua
horse_a = {}
horse_a["food"] = "apple"
horse_a["sayFood"] = function(self)
    print(self["food"])
end

horse_b = {}
horse_b["food"] = "hay"

horse_a["sayFood"](horse_a)
--> apple
horse_a["sayFood"](horse_b)
--> hay
```
`horse_a` is said to be a prototype of `horse_b`. Note how `horse_a` is still capable of functioning on its own, while `horse_b` must depend on `horse_a`.
If we make another similar table to `horse_b`, a `horse_c`, we could reuse the code from `horse_a` in a similar way.

A protoype is a table that contains all the data nesecary for another table to behave as the prototype does.

## Metatables and `__index`, and the Class-table, or How to build a morally questionable Horse Factory:

To simplify this pattern, as well as make it easier to reproduce, Lua provides the concept of "metatables".
A Metatable is a table in a special one-way relationship with another table established by calling `setmetatable(<table>, <metatable>)`.

A Metatable with a value at `"__index"` will allow its associated table to index into the table at `"__index"` as if it were part of the table, if such a value is `nil` in the original table. The value at `"__index"` can contain any table, including the metatable itself:
```lua
horse_a = {}
horse_a["__index"] = horse_a --metatables have "special" indexes that are treated differently from other indexes, "__index" is one of them.
horse_a["food"] = "apple"
horse_a["sayFood"] = function(self)
    print(self["food"])
end

horse_b = {}
horse_b["food"] = "hay"

setmetatable(horse_b, horse_a) --set horse_b's metatable to be horse_a

horse_b["sayFood"](horse_b) --lookup of "sayFood" fails on horse_b, so it looks in `horse_a`
--> hay
horse_b["food"] = nil
horse_b["sayFood"](horse_b) --lookup of "food" now also fails on horse_b, so it looks in `horse_a` 
--> apple
```

We can make a function at index `"new"` in `horse_a` to make new tables that are like it, and have `horse_a` as its metatable:
```lua
horse_a = {}
horse_a["__index"] = horse_a
horse_a["food"] = "apple"
horse_a["sayFood"] = function(self)
    print(self["food"])
end

horse_a["new"] = function(food)
    local new_horse = {} --make a new table
    setmetatable(new_horse, horse_a) --set its metatable to our horse_a prototype
    new_horse["food"] = food
    return horse
end

horse_b = horse_a.new("hay")

horse_b["sayFood"](horse_b) --lookup of "sayFood" fails on horse_b, so it looks in `horse_a`
--> hay
horse_b["food"] = nil
horse_b["sayFood"](horse_b) --lookup of "food" now also fails on horse_b, so it looks in `horse_a` 
--> apple
```
The function at index `"new"` is called a Constructor.
A Constructor is a function that returns an Instance of a Prototype or Class.
An Instance is a table that behaves like its Prototype, or according to its Class.

If we never intend to use `horse_a` on its own, we can remove some extraneous data, thus generalizing it into the `Horse` Class:
```lua
Horse = {}
Horse["__index"] = Horse
Horse["new"] = function(food)
    local new_horse = {} --make a new table
    setmetatable(new_horse, Horse) --set its metatable to our horse_a prototype
    new_horse["food"] = food
    return new_horse
end
Horse["sayFood"] = function(self)
    print(self["food"])
end

horse_b = Horse.new("hay")
```
A Class, in Lua, is the metatable that describes the behavior of its Instances.

## Polymorphism and Inheritance
Let us make another Class, `Cow`:
```lua
--Cow Class
Cow = {}
Cow["__index"] = Cow
Cow["new"] = function(food, moo)
    local new_cow = {} --make a new table
    setmetatable(new_cow, Cow) --set its metatable to our horse_a prototype
    new_cow["food"] = food
    new_cow["moo"] = moo
    return new_cow
end
Cow["sayFood"] = function(self)
    print(self["food"])
end
Cow["sayMoo"] = function(self)
    print(self["moo"])
end
--Horse Class
Horse = {}
Horse["__index"] = Horse
Horse["new"] = function(food)
    local new_horse = {} --make a new table
    setmetatable(new_horse, Horse) --set its metatable to our horse_a prototype
    new_horse["food"] = food
    return new_horse
end
Horse["sayFood"] = function(self)
    print(self["food"])
end
```
It shares most of its behavior with the `Horse` Class.
We can make a Class `Animal` that contains both behaviors, and then make `Horse` and `Cow` inherit the behavior of this new Class, utilizing the lookup properties of Metatables and the `__index` Metamethod:

```lua
--Animal Class
Animal = {}
Animal["__index"] = Animal
Animal["new"] = function(food)
    local new_animal = {}
    setmetatable(new_animal, animal)
    new_animal["food"] = food
    return new_horse
end
Animal["sayFood"] = function(self)
    print(self["food"])
end

--Cow Class
Cow = {}
Cow["__index"] = Cow
setmetatable(Cow, Animal)
Cow["new"] = function(food)
    local new_cow = Animal["new"](food)
    new_cow["moo"] = moo
    return new_cow
end
Cow["sayMoo"] = function(self)
    print(self["moo"])
end

--Horse Class
Horse = {}
Horse["__index"] = Horse
setmetatable(Horse, Animal)
--All the behavior of Horse is in Animal!

local cow_a = Cow.new("cud")
local horse_a = Horse.new("apple")
```
We say Classes `Cow` and `Horse` "Extends", "Implements", or are "Child Class"es of `Animal`. 
Likewise, `Animal` is the "Parent Class" or "Super Class" of both `Cow` and `Horse`

Note: It is possible, yet unsupported, in Kristal, to have a Child Class have multiple Parent Classes, and is not recommended.

Since all Constructors return a Instance of a Class, we can create a Class `Class` that describes every possible Child Class:
# This one's the right one we'll base everything off of. i torsted it :\)
```lua
--Class Class
Class = {}
Class["__index"] = Class
Class["new"] =  function()
    local instance = {}
    setmetatable(instance, Class)
    return instance
end
---------------------------------
--Animal Class
Animal = {}
Animal["__index"] = Animal
setmetatable(Animal, Class)
Animal["new"] = function(food)
    local new_animal = Class["new"]()
    setmetatable(new_animal, animal)
    new_animal["food"] = food
    return new_animal
end
Animal["sayFood"] = function(self)
    print(self["food"])
end

--Cow Class
Cow = {}
Cow["__index"] = Cow
setmetatable(Cow, Animal)
Cow["new"] = function(food, moo)
    local new_cow = Animal["new"](food)
    setmetatable(new_cow, Cow)
    new_cow["moo"] = moo
    return new_cow
end
Cow["sayMoo"] = function(self)
    print(self["moo"])
end

--Horse Class
Horse = {}
Horse["__index"] = Horse
setmetatable(Horse, Animal)
Horse["new"] = function(food)
    local new_horse = Animal["new"](food)
    setmetatable(new_horse, Horse)
    return new_horse
end
--All the behavior of Horse is in Animal!

local cow_a = Cow.new("cud", "mOoO")
cow_a["sayMoo"](cow_a)
--> mOoO
local horse_a = Horse.new("apple")
horse_a["sayFood"](horse_a)
--> apple
```
## OOP Syntax in Kristal

Up until now, we have been intentionally using syntax that is remniscent of traditional array structures.
This has been done so we can understand that Classes and their Instances are tables we establish special rules and relations about.

This syntax is not preferred, Kristal employs some syntatical and programatic tricks to make OOP more bearable.
The following snippets are equivilent<sup>[3]</sup> to eachother:

The left-hand syntax is more compact, reasonable, and readable,
and is typically used when writing mods for Kristal.
## Globals, The Registry, and Writing Class files
There are many Classes in Kristal that are exposed as global variables,
such as
<a href="/wiki/api/Sprite">`Sprite`</a>,
<a href="/wiki/api/Actor">`Actor`</a>,
and <a href="/wiki/api/Explosion">`Explosion`</a>.
As shown, you can make instances of these Classes simply
by calling the constructor in your code:
```lua
 sprite = Sprite("kristal")
```
We can now begin writing a new .lua file that we will put into our mod.
For more info on the file structure of mods, see <a href="/wiki/creating-a-mod">Mod File Structure</a>.

no, however you can copy and paste the old code and change what lines you want in the hook, or you can use the original function orig that gets passed into your hook by invoking orig(...)
~~
hooking just replaces a refrence to one function with another function

Snosibsnob — Yesterday at 8:59 PM

Oh shit it replaces the function entirely? That’s perfect

I was thinking it just inserted a new function

skarph — Yesterday at 9:01 PM

there's a bit of stuff going under the hood that kristal manages, but that's the gist

Snosibsnob — Yesterday at 9:03 PM

Wait is hooking handled differently by Kristal to Lua normally?

Or are the arguements the same

skarph — Yesterday at 9:04 PM

Utils.hook does not call debug.sethook, they're two different implementations. Utils.hook is preferred since it's properly integrated into the gamestate manager (your hooks dissapear when you leave your mod)

Snosibsnob — Yesterday at 9:05 PM

Got it

So what are the arguements Utils.hook uses 

skarph — Yesterday at 9:07 PM

Utils.hook(\<Table>, \<index>, \<hook_function>)

the hook function is garunteed* atleast one argument, orig, that is passed in as its first argument when \<Table>[\<index>}(...) is called.

so the following hooks into World:heal and makes it print a message to console, before continuing with the original World:heal

Utils.hook(World, "heal", function(orig, self, target, amount, text)

  print("hooked!")

  orig(self,target,amount,text)

end)

Snosibsnob — Yesterday at 9:16 PM

If the same table and index are called in multiple places is there any way to specify a specific instance

Bor (Missing Woods, DeltaWoods) — Yesterday at 9:17 PM

shouldnt orig() be put as the first line so if you override an existing thing, it doesnt get replaced by the default thing in the original code? or does it not matter

skarph — Yesterday at 9:18 PM

noooo but because you're thinking of tables wrong. you can hook into an instance of a class (wouldnt recommend it), and you can hook into a function of a whole class. both are individual tables as lua isnt object-oriented

Object is a table, and the result of Object() is also a table

skarph — Yesterday at 9:19 PM

it depends what you're trying to accomplish

in general yeah though

Snosibsnob — Yesterday at 9:20 PM

What would be the trouble with hooking into an instance?

skarph — Yesterday at 9:20 PM

you're violating OOP

Snosibsnob — Yesterday at 9:20 PM

Oh I see

It fucks with hierarchy or smth

skarph — Yesterday at 9:21 PM

are you familiar with how OOP works with lua?

Snosibsnob — Yesterday at 9:21 PM

Somewhat? Admittedly thus far I’ve just been treating Lua as I would C#

skarph — Yesterday at 9:21 PM

its extremely stupid and i remember having trouble with it

ah no it's a completely different beast

imagine everything is a hashmap

every thing that isnt a number, string, function, boolean, or nil

all tables are just glorified hashmaps

Snosibsnob — Yesterday at 9:22 PM

Oh, huh

Guess that makes sense given that Lua is so friendly towards strings

skarph — Yesterday at 9:24 PM

basically, an "instance" i  of a "class" C is just a table i that has a pointer to C. if you index into i and it cant find what your looking for, i will index into C to find what you want

read these for more info

https://www.lua.org/pil/13.html

https://www.lua.org/pil/13.4.1.html

https://www.lua.org/pil/16.html#ObjectSec

actually i should probably. put this all on the wiki

Image

oops

Snosibsnob — Yesterday at 9:27 PM

I think I see the problem here yeah



Hooking into an instance skips the hash function

skarph — Yesterday at 9:27 PM

yeaaah it's not so much the hash function as it is the lookup but yeah thats right

:ralseiyeah:

Snosibsnob — Yesterday at 9:28 PM

But you can still technically do it becuase both the instance and class are tables

skarph — Yesterday at 9:28 PM

yep! there's nothing stopping you

since they're both the same kind of data structure 

since it's a very barebones systsem, there's a few libraries + some bespoke ones kristal uses for handeling classes

Snosibsnob — Yesterday at 9:29 PM

Given what I’ve read when looking at magic glass’ code I don’t think it should be that big of an issue to hook into the class

skarph — Yesterday at 9:29 PM

kristal mainly uses hump's implementation of classes https://hump.readthedocs.io/en/latest/class.html

as well as having some of it's own convention and convieneces that differ from hump

Snosibsnob — Yesterday at 9:30 PM

Thanks for all the info!

skarph — Yesterday at 9:31 PM

🫠 again i should probably put this on the wiki, lemme try to write up this convo because it actually got a lot of things i wanted to say out

(still gotta do more research lol)

    --note the implied argument self that gets passed in first. this is our Instance, and it is already set up
