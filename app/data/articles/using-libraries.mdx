Libraries are like little sub-mods which you can add to your mod. They can add enemies, spells, items, even gameplay mechanics! So here's how to use them.

## Adding a Library
---

To add a library, you need to have a `libraries` folder in your mod's root directory. Then, just add the library's `.zip` file to the folder, and you're done! Simple, right?

Libraries can be loaded as both `.zip` files, *and* as folders.



## Troubleshooting
---

### The library doesn't do anything!

- Make sure the `libraries` folder is in the right place, being in your mod's root directory
- Make sure the library's `.zip` file (if it is one) doesn't have an extra folder in it (e.g. `mylibrary.zip/mylibrary/`)

### The library is causing errors!

- Make sure the library is compatible with the version of Kristal you're using
- Make sure the library has all of its files and dependencies
