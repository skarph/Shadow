Each battle is an **encounter**. Each different group of monsters, each different boss, each different single monster, they're all **encounters**. Undertale used this system, Deltarune used it, and we will as well.




## Encounter Basics
---

To start creating an encounter, you'll need to create a new file in the `encounters` folder. Let's make an encounter with a single monster, being the Dummy enemy we made.

```lua
local Dummy, super = Class(Encounter)

function Dummy:init()
    super.init(self)

    -- Text displayed at the bottom of the screen at the start of the encounter
    self.text = "* The tutorial begins...?"

    -- Battle music ("battle" is rude buster)
    self.music = "battle"
    -- Enables the purple grid battle background
    self.background = true

    -- Add the dummy enemy to the encounter
    self:addEnemy("dummy")

    --- Uncomment this line to add another!
    --self:addEnemy("dummy")
end

return Dummy
```

Aaaaaaaaand we're done.




## Advanced Encounters
---

Okay, okay, some encounters are more advanced than that. For example, if you want to hide the world even if there's no background, you can set `self.hide_world` to true. Battles can also skip the YOU WON! text with `self.no_end_message = true`.

Encounters also have a massive list of callbacks, which you can read about [here](/wiki/api/Encounter).
