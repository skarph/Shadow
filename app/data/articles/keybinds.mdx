Keybinds are important. They're the things that let you actually play the game.
Kristal has a lot of bindings, from player movement to debug features.

However, what if you wanted to add your own keybind? Like, say, a dance button?




## Registering a Keybind

To register a keybind, you must create a `keybinds` section in your mod's (or library's) `mod.json`/`lib.json`,
and populate it with the keys you'd like to have in your mod/library.

For example, this is a dancing keybind:

```json
{
    "keybinds": [
        {
            "name": "Dance",
            "id": "dance",
            "keys": ["a"],
            "gamepad": ["gamepad:leftshoulder"]
        }
    ]
}
```

It should look something like this:

Keys should be **lowercase**, and gamepad buttons should be one of [the buttons listed here](https://love2d.org/wiki/GamepadButton), prefixed with `gamepad:`.

Additionally, `lsup`, `lsdown`, `lsleft`, and `lsright` are the left stick directions, and `rsup`, `rsdown`, `rsleft`, and `rsright` are the right stick directions. `lefttrigger` and `righttrigger` are the left and right triggers.




## Using the Keybind

Using the new custom keybind is like using any other keybind in Kristal.

You can use the `Input` class to check if the keybind is pressed:

```lua
if Input:down("dance") then
    Game.world.player:setAnimation("dancing")
end
```

Or if you're using a callback, check if the pressed key is the dance key:

```lua
function Mod:onKeyPressed(key)
    if Input.is("dance", key) then
        Game.world.player:setAnimation("dancing")
    end
end
```
