Let's make a simple cutscene, where:

- The player walks to the center of the room
- The screen fades to black
- A textbox appears
- An impact sound plays
- The screen fades back in

That's just a set of instructions, isn't it? In order? Yeah, that's pretty much what cutscenes are in code as well!

Let's start by marking the center of the room. Remember markers?

Let's also place down a `script` object. This'll trigger our cutscene when the player touches it.

As you can see, we gave it the cutscene ID `examples.center`. This means it'll play the `center` cutscene from the `examples` group!

Now, let's make the `examples` group. We'll do this by creating an `examples.lua` file in the `scripts/world/cutscenes` folder.

Let's slap a table in there:

```lua
return {

}
```

Now we're ready to start our cutscene! Remember, we named it `center`, so let's do that:

```lua
return {
    center = function(cutscene, event)

    end
}
```

Woah, what'd we just do?

We just created `center` in the `examples` group, which is a function that takes two arguments: `cutscene` and `event`. `cutscene` is the cutscene object, and `event` is the event object, aka what triggered the cutscene.

Now, let's script the cutscene!

```lua
return {
    center = function(cutscene, event)
        -- make kris walk to the "room_center" marker, taking 1 second, and wait until they're done
        cutscene:wait(cutscene:walkTo("kris", "room_center", 1))
        -- fade the screen to black
        cutscene:wait(cutscene:fadeOut(1))
        -- show a textbox
        cutscene:text("* ...")
        -- play the impact sound
        Assets.playSound("impact")
        -- wait 1 second
        cutscene:wait(1)
        -- fade the screen back in
        cutscene:wait(cutscene:fadeIn(1))
    end
}
```

Seems pretty simple, right? The cutscene system is much, much more powerful than this, but it's a good start.
